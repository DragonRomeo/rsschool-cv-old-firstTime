### About me:
The last position I held was the head of the content department in the online store. I did not acquire programming skills from there, but I acquired some soft skills and I believe that they will be useful to me in the future. 

Now I'm taking Rsschool courses on front-end development, before that I taught a little with html, css and Java. I consider my strengths: diligence, ability to work in a team, if I see a problem, then I try to solve it. Learning English in process.
